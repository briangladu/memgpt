## Before getting started

TODO talk about how users need to have configured memgpt, link to memgpt official docs

## Starting a server process

You can spawn a MemGPT server process using the following command:

```sh
memgpt server
```

Before attempting to launch a server process, make sure that you have already configured MemGPT (using `memgpt configure`) and are able to successfully create and message an agent using `memgpt run`. For more information, see [our quickstart guide](https://memgpt.readme.io/docs/quickstart).

## Example: basic usage

### Creating a user

### Creating an agent

### Sending a message to an agent and receiving the reply
